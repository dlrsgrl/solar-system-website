                <p class="text">
                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Venus is the third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in
                    the opposite direction from most planets.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth's evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the 
                    hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Below the dense, persistent clouds, the surface has volcanoes and deformed mountains.

                <h3 class="info-title">Namesake</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    The ancient Romans could easily see seven bright objects in the sky: the Sun, the Moon, and the five brightest planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They named 
                    the objects after their most important gods.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Venus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the ancient Greeks. Most features on Venus are named for women. It&#8217;s the only 
                    planet named after a female god.

                <h3 class="info-title">Potential for Life</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    Thirty miles up (about 50 kilometers) from the surface of Venus temperatures range from 86 to 158 Fahrenheit (30 to 70 Celsius). This temperature range could accommodate Earthly 
                    life, such as “extremophile” microbes. And atmospheric pressure at that height is similar to what we find on Earth&#8217;s surface.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    At the tops of Venus&#8217; clouds, whipped around the planet by winds measured as high as 224 mph (360 kph), we find another transformation. Persistent, dark streaks appear. Scientists 
                    are so far unable to explain why these streaks remain stubbornly intact, even amid hurricane-force winds. They also have the odd habit of absorbing ultraviolet radiation.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The most likely explanations focus on fine particles, ice crystals, or even a chemical compound called iron chloride. Although it's much less likely, another possibility considered by 
                    scientists who study astrobiology is that these streaks could be made up of microbial life, Venus-style. Astrobiologists note that ring-shaped linkages of sulfur atoms, known to exist in 
                    Venus&#8217; atmosphere, could provide microbes with a kind of coating that would protect them from sulfuric acid. These handy chemical cloaks would also absorb potentially damaging ultraviolet 
                    light and re-radiate it as visible light.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    None of these findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of life in Venus’ clouds. But the questions they raise, along with Venus’ vanished ocean, its violently volcanic surface, 
                    and its hellish history, make a compelling case for missions to investigate our temperamental sister planet. There is much, it would seem, that she can teach us.

              <h3 class="info-title">Size and Distance</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    Venus orbits the Sun from an average distance of 67 million miles (108 million kilometers), or 0.72 astronomical units. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance 
                    from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight about six minutes to travel from the Sun to Venus.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Earth's nearness to Venus is a matter of perspective. The planet is nearly as big around as Earth. Its diameter at its equator is about 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers), versus 
                    7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) for Earth. From Earth, Venus is the brightest object in the night sky after our own Moon. The ancients, therefore, gave it great importance in 
                    their cultures, even thinking it was two objects: a morning star and an evening star. That’s where the trick of perspective comes in.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Because Venus’ orbit is closer to the Sun than ours, the two of them – from our viewpoint – never stray far from each other. The ancient Egyptians and Greeks saw Venus in 
                    two guises: first in one orbital position (seen in the morning), then another (your “evening” Venus), just at different times of the year.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    At its nearest to Earth, Venus is about 24 million (about 38 million kilometers) away. But most of the time the two planets are farther apart. The maximum distance 
                    between Venus and Earth is about 162 million miles (261 million kilometers). Mercury, the innermost planet, actually spends more time in Earth’s proximity than Venus.

                <h3 class="info-title">Orbit and Rotation</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    Spending a day on Venus would be quite a disorienting experience – that is, if your spacecraft or spacesuit could protect you from temperatures in the range of 900 degrees 
                    Fahrenheit (475 Celsius). For one thing, your “day” would be 243 Earth days long – longer even than a Venus year (one trip around the Sun), which takes only 225 Earth days. 
                    For another, because of the planet's extremely slow rotation, sunrise to sunset would take 117 Earth days. And by the way, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east, 
                    because Venus spins backward compared to Earth.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    While you’re waiting, don’t expect any seasonal relief from the unrelenting temperatures. On Earth, with its spin axis tilted by about 23 degrees, we experience summer when our 
                    part of the planet (our hemisphere) receives the Sun’s rays more directly – a result of that tilt. In winter, the tilt means the rays are less direct. No such luck on Venus: Its 
                    very slight tilt is only three degrees, which is too little to produce noticeable seasons.
