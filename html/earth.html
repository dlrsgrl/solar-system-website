                  <p class="text">
                    While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. 
                    Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

                  <p class="text">
                    Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. 
                    It simply means "the ground." There are, of course, many names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.

                  <p class="text">
                    The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. 
                    However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”

              <p class="text">
                Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in 
                liquid water, since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 
                billion years ago.

                <h3 class="info-title">Size and Distance</h3>
              <p class="text">
                With an equatorial diameter of 7926 miles (12,760 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets and the fifth largest planet in our solar system.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), 
                is the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.

             <h3 class="info-title">Orbit and Rotation</h3>
              <p class="text">
                As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge 
                to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is 
                called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a leap year.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, 
                the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar heating is greater in the north producing 
                summer there. Less direct solar heating produces winter in the south. Six months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly 
                equal amounts of heat from the Sun.

              <p class="text">
                Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object in the night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making 
                Earth such a great home. It stabilizes our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks. They are typically trapped by Earth's gravity for a few months or years before returning to an orbit 
                around the Sun. Some asteroids will be in a long “dance” with Earth as both orbit the Sun.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                Some moons are bits of rock that were captured by a planet's gravity, but our Moon is likely the result of a collision billions of years ago. When Earth was a young planet, 
                a large chunk of rock smashed into it, displacing a portion of Earth's interior. The resulting chunks clumped together and formed our Moon. With a radius of 1,080 miles 
                (1,738 kilometers), the Moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar system (after Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, and Io).
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away from Earth. That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in between Earth and its Moon.
