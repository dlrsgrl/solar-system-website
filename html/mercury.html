                <p class="text">
                    Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800째F (430째C). Without an 
                    atmosphere to retain that heat at night, temperatures can dip as low as -290째F (-180째C).
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system &#8208;that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury 
                    is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.

                <p class="text">
                    Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.

                <h3 class="info-title">Potential for Life</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to 
                    adapt to.

                <h3 class="info-title">Size and Distance</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a 
                    blueberry.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the 
                    distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.

              <h3 class="info-title">Orbit and Rotation</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    Mercury's highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles (47 million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers) 
                    from the Sun. It speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any other planet.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest 
                    to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some 
                    parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth 
                    days &#8208; just over two years on Mercury.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Mercury's axis of rotation is tilted just 2 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and so does not experience 
                    seasons as many other planets do.

                <h3 class="info-title">Formation</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet nearest the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets,
                    Mercury has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.
                </p>
                <h3 class="info-title">Structure</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85% of the planet's radius. There
                     is evidence that it is partly molten or liquid. Mercury's outer shell, comparable to Earth's outer shell (called the mantle and crust), is only about 400 kilometers 
                     (250 miles) thick.
