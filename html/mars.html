                <p class="text">
                  Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien 
                  landscape. NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of
                  years ago.

                    <p class="text">
                      Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. Other civilizations
                      also named the planet for this attribute - for example, the Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one." Even today,
                      it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.

                <p class="text">
                  Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long 
                  ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.

                  <h3 class="info-title">Size and Distance</h3>
                <p class="text">
                  With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, 
                  Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                  From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. 
                  One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 
                  minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.

                  <h3 class="info-title">Orbit and Rotation</h3>
                <p class="text">
                  As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). 
                  Martian days are called sols - short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                  Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This is another similarity 
                  with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun (because it's farther away). And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.

                  <p class="text">
                    Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids. They're potato-shaped because they have too little 
                    mass for gravity to make them spherical.              
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">
                    The moons get their names from the horses that pulled the chariot of the Greek god of war, Ares.            
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">
                    Phobos, the innermost and larger moon, is heavily cratered, with deep grooves on its surface. It is slowly moving towards Mars 
                    and will crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million years.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">
                    Deimos is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two and a half times farther away from Mars. Oddly-shaped Deimos is covered in 
                    loose dirt that often fills the craters on its surface, making it appear smoother than pockmarked Phobos.

                  Mars has no rings. However, in 50 million years when Phobos crashes into Mars or breaks apart, it could create a dusty ring around the Red Planet.

                  <h3 class="info-title">Formation</h3>
                <p class="text">
                  When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the 
                  Sun. Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.

                <section>
                  <h3 class="info-title">Structure</h3>
                <p class="text">
                  Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It's made of iron, nickel, and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle 
                  between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep.
