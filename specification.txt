I used Bootstrap for navigation bar with a dropdown linked list.
I used JavaScript to fetch and load the navbar from an external file, set up scrollable navigation for the planets section, added zoom-in and zoom-out functionality, 
enabled tooltips on hover, and implemented link functionality for the planets.Also, I added event listeners to navigation buttons to control scrolling and made 
them unclickable after a certain point.
